 * Audio Server
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The server waits expects at least one WAV file in its local directory. It
 * waits for a client request to read one of its files. When it receives a such
 * request, it opens the underlying file and start its transfert to the client.
 * When the file is entirely read, the server closes the file and waits for the
 * next request.
